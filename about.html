            <h3>We are small studio of two, so we appreciate you visiting our site!</h3>
            <p>
                Founded on December 27th, 2024, we formed with a few simple goals in mind; make fun games, and have fun doing it. 
                As of present, we are working on two as of yet untitled games, temporarily named Project DS and Project Delicious. 
                From the aforementioned games, Project DS is a cozy social game about fishing and farming, and Project Delicious 
                is an action orienteg RPG. We are based out of two states within the United States, however we hope to branch out 
                further in the future, but we don't plan on losing sight of our simple goals, as it is those simple goals that 
                inspired us to make games in the first place.
